				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browswer or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called idenifiers<span> var x;</span></li>
					<li><a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.<span>var x = 10</span></li>
					<li><a href="#">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean -<span>true</span> or<span>false;</span>null -<span>null</span>aka nothing; Number -<span>42</span>or<span>3.14159;</span>String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>Array -<span>[1,'Coding',2, Dojo'];</span>and Object -<span>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'</span></li>
					<li><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to preform different actions for different descisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:<span>if</span>a specified condition is true, do this code in your code block;<span>else if</span>to specify a new condition test, if the first condition is false;<span>else</span>we exectue this block of code;</li>
					<li><a href="#">Loops</a>there are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine that you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
					<li><a href="#">Functions</a>Functions are the encapsulation of a code block. When we call our functions this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table top the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton of more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
